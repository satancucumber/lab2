hey hey hey hey heyi write this to explain why ill be holding back my album  from the new streaming service apple music i feel this deserves an explanation because apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans i respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries  im sure you are aware that apple music will be offering a free  month trial to anyone who signs up for the service im not sure you know that apple music will not be paying writers producers or artists for those three months i find it to be shocking disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company  this is not about me thankfully i am on my fifth album and can support myself my band crew and entire management team by playing live shows this is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success this is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt this is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create just like the innovators and creators at apple are pioneering in their fieldbut will not get paid for a quarter of a years worth of plays on his or her songs  these are not the complaints of a spoiled petulant child these are the echoed sentiments of every artist writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect apple so much we simply do not respect this particular call  i realize that apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming i think that is beautiful progress we know how astronomically successful apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists writers and producers for the  month trial period even if it is free for the fans trying it out  three months is a long time to go unpaid and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing i say this with love reverence and admiration for everything else apple has done i hope that soon i can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music i think this could be the platform that gets it right  but i say to apple with all due respect its not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this we dont ask you for free iphones please dont ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation  tayloronly had a little taste but i remember how it felt and all the phone calls late at night though we tried we couldnt make it right  when the seasons changed everything got colder everyone could hear our illusion crush it was all we had  so every minute that ive spend with you like the winter is bringing the blues you and i were like the spring brief and beautiful  when we knew we had to let it go and our love turned in to snow we never had a chance to begin brief and beautiful so brief and beautiful so  when flowers bloom in may i go back to yesterday when i woke up next to you i would bring it all back if i could  make it good or bad i know it is too late so im moving on but i wont forget all that is unsaid  so every minute that ive spend with you like the winter is bringing the blues you and i were like the spring brief and beautiful  when we knew we had to let it go and our love turned in to snow we never had a chance to begin brief and beautiful so brief and beautiful so  it was so short it was so sweet like every good thing its not yours to keep everything fades away and now its gonewould you love me right   my life

scared of me i remember you this feeling isnt new so please dont be scared of me please dont be scared of me   dont take this the wrong way but uh i never cried when pac died but i probably will when

to thank nickelodeon for making a childhood dream of mine come true for being a family to me for being so accommodating and supportive of my multitasking with my music career and for of course ducing me to many of my fans however many years ago i want to thank dan schneider for allowing me to play such a special beautiful character who i hid behind for so long what i mean by that is when i was younger people loved cat so much i used to pretend to be more like her it took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are i think thats honestly because i admire her so much her appreciation for life and everybody she encounters her passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread like school projects and work she always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good  i will always hold cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult i know she seems like a simple daft character and she is but she played such a huge part in my life i just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things i love most about her i think a lot of people could take a page out of her book she wouldnt judge anybody by their appearance she believed the best in people she wasnt afraid of anything or anybody she never let peoples judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted acting how she wanted dressing how she wanted wanted dying her hair however she wanted she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real which is something i personally do all the time but i wish i could shake that and celebrate every little thing like she does  one of my favorite things about cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder as we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across we hold back a little more protect ourselves a little more and although cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up she never changed or lost her childlike wonder to me thats the bravest most special thing about her she actually reminds me a lot of frankie in that way  so i know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some dumb kids show character     but to me she is actually a lot smarter stronger and braver than all the rest of us  hopefully well find out one day if cat  robbie ever got married if i had any say in the story from here on out id make sure they were happily married with sweet eccentric jewish artificially red headed babies cat would constantly find herself reminding aunt sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house theyd live down the street from jade and beck also happily married with purple and black haired pale grungy beautiful goth babies   thank you to the cast and crew who i spent almost every day with for a good  or  years thanks for lighting us beautifully shooting us beautifully making the most incredible props yelling at us when we were running late to set keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment the guys behind the scenes couldnt have been more pleasant or hard working and i appreciate them for that so much i cant imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in hollywood  thank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine dan schneider i will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted  lastly thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started you are the most loyal dedicated and continuously loving supporters i could ever imagine weve been through so much and you are still here and weve got a long way to go  thank you for believing in me accepting me and loving me i love you foreveri feel weak weve been here before cause i feel we keep going back and forth maybe its over maybe were through but i honestly

with song writing so what ive done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started different ways so ill explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how i put songs together  i sent this voice memo to ryan tedder because id always wanted to work with him and finally we scheduled some studio time so i always wanna be prepared i wanted to send him the idea that i was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said i cant stand that i wanna work on something else think of something else so i just sat down with the piano put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where i wanted to go with the song how i saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called i know places so this was the voice memo i sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song  okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing  uhuhuhoh ohohohi ohohoh ohohohi ohohohoh ohohohiii  na na na na waiting at the back door theyre around and the vultures come around and you know that they wont they wont us say what they want bout say what they want bout us and you come and sing and listen i would not think about it but im not done every know that a thing or two about it thing or two about it i  cause they got

got me looking got me looking so crazy your lovei see music its more than justwhat i hear when im connected to something i immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or emotion a memory from my childhood thoughts about life my dreams or my fantasies and theyre all connected to the music and i think thats one of the reasons why i wanted to do a visual album i wanted people to hear the songs with the story thats in my head cause its what makes it mine that vision in my brain is what i want people to experience the first time    i feel like right now people experience music differently i remember seeing thriller on tv with my family it was an event we all sat around the tv and now looking back im so lucky i was born around that time i miss thatimmersive experience now people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their ipods  they dont really invest in a full album its all about the single and the hype theres so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans i felt like i dont want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out i just want this to come out when its ready and from me to my fans i told my team i wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time everyone thought i was crazy but were actually doing it its happening    i wanted to make this body of work and i feel like its something thats lost in pop music i wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album it was important that we made this a movie we made this an experience i wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me i would make my best art and just put it out and thatsthats why its out todaythis bitch gon make me   you got me all up in my feels in all kindЂofЂways i be trynaЂwait but lately i just wannaЂkeep it real real no more playin safe lets take it all

expressing sexuality men take their shirts off  express their sexuality onstage in videos on instagram anywhere they want to all the time the double standard is so boring and exhausting with all due respect i think its time you get your head out of your ass sic women can love their bodies too  responding to a commenter who said she was like a whore in her dangerous woman video on facebook  the incredible double standard that we women face on a daily basis in the industry and just in the world its shocking i would be so amused and pardon me if this comes across as sexist but i dont think a male artist would be in this position right now sorry if im speaking about something that im passionate about im willing to take the brunt for fighting in what i believe in and my fellow women are definitely something that i will always be one of the first to speak up about  is this what you think girls have trouble choosing between  is this men assuming that thats what girls would have to choose between  you need a little brushing up on equality over here  i have a long list of things id like to change  i think judgement in general intolerance meanness double standards misogyny racism sexism you know all that shit theres lots weve got to get started on thats what we need to focus on weve got work to do  responding to the question if you could use makeup or your phone one last time what would you pick on californias power  fm  im tired of needing to be linked to a guy im not big seans ex im not nialls new possible girl im ariana grande  to the sun  what i meant when i said what i said about not being seans ex is that i am tired of living in world where women are mostly referred to as a mans past present or future property  possession i  do not belong to anyone but myself and neither do you  i cant wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who theyre dating married attached to having sex with or not seen with  but by their value as an individual   people are so ignorant sometimes stop trying to make people feel badly about their bodies its okay to be different  to be curvy or to be thin when did it become socially acceptable to comment on what you think is wrong with other peoples bodies we were having fun dancing on stage whats she shaking tho im shaking my pretty cute petite ass next to nickis pretty big booty both are fing awesome how about we respect peoples body boundaries and encourage each other to feel like a babe no matter how they are that would be nice so tired of watching everyone try to tear each other down  on instagram  gloria steinem published an article in  titled after black power womens liberation and  years later  were still not quite there yet if a woman has lots of sex or any sex for that matter  shes a slut if a man has sex  hes a stud a bossssss a king if a woman even talks about sex openly  she is shamed but if a man talks or raps freely about all the women or more commonly used bitcheshoes  how lovely hes had  he is regaled if a woman is seen with a friend with a penis there is immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled if a man is seen with a woman his status is elevatedcelebrated  on

put me in oh yeah  and im so sorry ive been known to hurry and baby i hope that im sorry cause tonightim not a rapper im a singer with a flow ive got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know youll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in i never want to get bitten cause plagiarism is hidden watch how i sit on the rhythm prisoner with the vision signed to a label but didnt listen to any criticism thought you knew but you didnt so perk your ears up and listen studio is a system and you could say that im driven and now its onto the next saga we drink the best lager ill never try to win you over like your stepfather ill do my own thing now and get respect after and im avoiding the caine like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay but its safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight at  years old yeah i moved out of my home i was macy gray i tried to say goodbye and i choked and went from sleeping at a subway station to sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population not my imagination i dont wanna relax would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax ill take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us dont you fade into the back love no   i take it back with the rhythm and blues with my rap pack ill be singing the news tryna act like jack black when i bring it to school ill make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes ill give you the truth through the vocal booth and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again thats what theyre supposed to do and im supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering everything that happens is from now on ill be ready to start again by the end of the song and still theyre claiming that i handle it wrong but then ive never had an enemy except the nme but ill be selling twice as many copies as their magazinesll ever be with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree singing for the masses rubber dinghy rapids i keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic im battling for respect and i dont know if ill have it this songs from the heart covered the planet ill take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us dont you fade into the back love no ill take it back now   now i dont ever wanna be perfect cause im a singer that you never wanna see shirtless and i accept the fact that someones gotta win worstdressed taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus putting on a brave face like timothy dalton considering a name change thinking it was hopeless rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written now absence can make your heart ache but drinking absinthe can change your mind state vividly need to let my liver be and ill say it again living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends its good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally cause thats how its supposed to be im screaming out vocally it might seem totally impossible achieving lifes dreams but but i just write schemes im never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be but more likely youll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint with mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that well never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down thats how we plan it out its time to take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us dont you fade into the back love no mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us dont you fade into the back love no   my dreams keep me awake at night written in rhyme till i deliver the hype am i just living a lie with this you must know that the numbers just sold will keep me going through the tough times dream with me we forget  percent of it when we wake but the other  percent it never fades dreaming dreams of daytoday goals stay awake loads tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade oh never give up just remember just to hold out more a couple years ago i couldnt just control that thought youd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors now im sweating on the stage of a soldout tour writing love songs for the sake of it never to make a hit you cant fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick im not a rapper im a singer i just take the piss and most of these other guys are kids that pose his little sister has to babysit thats

break our fall  breakdown will you take a moment promise me this that youll stand by me forever but if god forbid fate should step in and force us into a goodbye if you have children some day when they point to the pictures please tell them my name tell them how the crowds went wild tell them how i hope they shine long live the walls we crashed through i had the time of my life with you   long long live the walls we crashed through all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you i was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders im not afraid singing long live
