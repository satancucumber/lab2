i write this to explain why ill be holding back my album 989 from the new streaming service apple music i feel this deserves an explanation because apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans i respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries  im sure you are aware that apple music will be offering a free  month trial to anyone who signs up for the service im not sure you know that apple music will not be paying writers producers or artists for those three months i find it to be shocking disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company  this is not about me thankfully i am on my fifth album and can support myself my band crew and entire management team by playing live shows this is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success this is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt this is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create just like the innovators and creators at apple are pioneering in their fieldbut will not get paid for a quarter of a years worth of plays on his or her songs  these are not the complaints of a spoiled petulant child these are the echoed sentiments of every artist writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect apple so much we simply do not respect this particular call  i realize that apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming i think that is beautiful progress we know how astronomically successful apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists writers and producers for the  month trial period even if it is free for the fans trying it out  three months is a long time to go unpaid and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing i say this with love reverence and admiration for everything else apple has done i hope that soon i can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music i think this could be the platform that gets it right  but i say to apple with all due respect its not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this we dont ask you for free iphones please dont ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation  taylor

so the news is out about sam  cat i felt it wasnt my place to make any sort of announcement so i kept quiet until now i want to thank nickelodeon for making a childhood dream of mine come true for being a family to me for being so accommodating and supportive of my multitasking with my music career and for of course ducing me to many of my fans however many years ago i want to thank dan schneider for allowing me to play such a special beautiful character who i hid behind for so long what i mean by that is when i was younger people loved cat so much i used to pretend to be more like her it took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are i think thats honestly because i admire her so much her appreciation for life and everybody she encounters her passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread like school projects and work she always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good  i will always hold cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult i know she seems like a simple daft character and she is but she played such a huge part in my life i just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things i love most about her i think a lot of people could take a page out of her book she wouldnt judge anybody by their appearance she believed the best in people she wasnt afraid of anything or anybody she never let peoples judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted acting how she wanted dressing how she wanted wanted dying her hair however she wanted she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real which is something i personally do all the time but i wish i could shake that and celebrate every little thing like she does  one of my favorite things about cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder as we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across we hold back a little more protect ourselves a little more and although cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up she never changed or lost her childlike wonder to me thats the bravest most special thing about her she actually reminds me a lot of frankie in that way  so i know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some dumb kids show character     but to me she is actually a lot smarter stronger and braver than all the rest of us  hopefully well find out one day if cat  robbie ever got married if i had any say in the story from here on out id make sure they were happily married with sweet eccentric jewish artificially red headed babies cat would constantly find herself reminding aunt sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house theyd live down the street from jade and beck also happily married with purple and black haired pale grungy beautiful goth babies   thank you to the cast and crew who i spent almost every day with for a good 4 or 5 years thanks for lighting us beautifully shooting us beautifully making the most incredible props yelling at us when we were running late to set keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment the guys behind the scenes couldnt have been more pleasant or hard working and i appreciate them for that so much i cant imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in hollywood  thank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine dan schneider i will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted  lastly thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started you are the most loyal dedicated and continuously loving supporters i could ever imagine weve been through so much and you are still here and weve got a long way to go  thank you for believing in me accepting me and loving me i love you forever

so over the years a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end how long does it take where do you write what are the circumstances do you start with music do you start with lyrics and my answer is always that it happens differently every time and that's why i'm still so in love with song writing so what i've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started different ways so i'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how i put songs together  i sent this voice memo to ryan tedder because i'd always wanted to work with him and finally we scheduled some studio time so i always wanna be prepared i wanted to send him the idea that i was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said i can't stand that i wanna work on something else think of something else so i just sat down with the piano put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where i wanted to go with the song how i saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called i know places so this was the voice memo i sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song  okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing  uhuhuhoh ohohohi ohohoh ohohohi ohohohoh ohohohiii  na na na na waiting at the back door they're around and the vultures come around and you know that they won't they won't us say what they want 'bout say what they want 'bout us and you come and sing and listen i would not think about it but i'm not done every know that a thing or two about it thing or two about it i  cause they got the cages they got the boxes and guns they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run  baby i know some places we won't be found and they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down cause i i know places we can hide i know places i know places  uhuhuhi uhuhuhi ohohi uhuhuhi know places  or whatever i don't know but that's basically just like a dark really dark lyric like  thing and it's about like everybody's like trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever and it's like you just whatever you know and the  would just go to that major and just be like ooh  so i hope you like it it wouldn't be a piano thing it would be like vocalizing like very like beat now i'm just making weird sounds hope you like it

i see music it's more than justwhat i hear when i'm connected to something i immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or emotion a memory from my childhood thoughts about life my dreams or my fantasies and they're all connected to the music and i think that's one of the reasons why i wanted to do a visual album i wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head cause it's what makes it mine that vision in my brain is what i want people to experience the first time    i feel like right now people experience music differently i remember seeing thriller on tv with my family it was an event we all sat around the tv and now looking back i'm so lucky i was born around that time i miss thatimmersive experience now people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their ipods  they don't really invest in a full album it's all about the single and the hype there's so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans i felt like 'i don't want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out i just want this to come out when it's ready and from me to my fans' i told my team 'i wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time' everyone thought i was crazy but we're actually doing it it's happening    i wanted to make this body of work and i feel like it's something that's lost in pop music i wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album it was important that we made this a movie we made this an experience i wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me i would make my best art and just put it out and that'sthat's why it's out today

when will people stop being offended by women showing skin  expressing sexuality men take their shirts off  express their sexuality onstage in videos on instagram anywhere they want to all the time the double standard is so boring and exhausting with all due respect i think it's time you get your head out of your ass sic women can love their bodies too  responding to a commenter who said she was like a whore in her dangerous woman video on facebook  the incredible double standard that we women face on a daily basis in the industry and just in the world it's shocking i would be so amused and pardon me if this comes across as sexist but i don't think a male artist would be in this position right now sorry if i'm speaking about something that i'm passionate about i'm willing to take the brunt for fighting in what i believe in and my fellow women are definitely something that i will always be one of the first to speak up about  is this what you think girls have trouble choosing between  is this men assuming that that's what girls would have to choose between  you need a little brushing up on equality over here  i have a long list of things i'd like to change  i think judgement in general intolerance meanness double standards misogyny racism sexism you know all that shit there's lots we've got to get started on that's what we need to focus on we've got work to do  responding to the question if you could use makeup or your phone one last time what would you pick on california's power 06 fm  i'm tired of needing to be linked to a guy i'm not big sean's ex i'm not niall's new possible girl i'm ariana grande  to the sun  what i meant when i said what i said about not being sean's ex is that i am tired of living in world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past present or future property  possession i  do not belong to anyone but myself and neither do you  i can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating married attached to having sex with or not seen with  but by their value as an individual   people are so ignorant sometimes stop trying to make people feel badly about their bodies it's okay to be different  to be curvy or to be thin when did it become socially acceptable to comment on what you think is 'wrong' with other people's bodies we were having fun dancing on stage 'what's she shaking tho' i'm shaking my pretty cute petite ass next to nicki's pretty big booty both are fing awesome how about we respect people's body boundaries and encourage each other to feel like a babe no matter how they are that would be nice so tired of watching everyone try to tear each other down  on instagram  gloria steinem published an article in 969 titled 'after black power women's liberation' and 46 years later  we're still not quite there yet if a woman has lots of sex or any sex for that matter  she's a 'slut' if a man has sex  he's a stud a bossssss a king if a woman even talks about sex openly  she is shamed but if a man talks or raps freely about all the women or more commonly used 'bitches'hoes'  how lovely he's had  he is regaled if a woman is seen with a friend with a penis there is immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled if a man is seen with a woman his status is elevatedcelebrated  on twitter

i'm not a rapper i'm a singer with a flow i've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know you'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in i never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden watch how i sit on the rhythm prisoner with the vision signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism thought you knew but you didn't so perk your ears up and listen studio is a system and you could say that i'm driven and now it's onto the next saga we drink the best lager i'll never try to win you over like your stepfather i'll do my own thing now and get respect after and i'm avoiding the 'caine like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay but it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight at 6 years old yeah i moved out of my home i was macy gray i tried to say goodbye and i choked and went from sleeping at a subway station to sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population not my imagination i don't wanna relax would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax i'll take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no   i take it back with the rhythm and blues with my rap pack i'll be singing the news tryna act like jack black when i bring it to school i'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes i'll give you the truth through the vocal booth and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again that's what they're supposed to do and i'm supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering everything that happens is from now on i'll be ready to start again by the end of the song and still they're claiming that i handle it wrong but then i've never had an enemy except the nme but i'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree singing for the masses rubber dinghy rapids i keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic i'm battling for respect and i don't know if i'll have it this song's from the heart covered the planet i'll take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no i'll take it back now   now i don't ever wanna be perfect 'cause i'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless and i accept the fact that someone's gotta win worstdressed taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus putting on a brave face like timothy dalton considering a name change thinking it was hopeless rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition 'cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written now absence can make your heart ache but drinking absinthe can change your mind state vividly need to let my liver be and i'll say it again living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends it's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally 'cause that's how it's supposed to be i'm screaming out vocally it might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams but but i just write schemes i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be but more likely you'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint with mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down that's how we plan it out it's time to take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no  4 my dreams keep me awake at night written in rhyme till i deliver the hype am i just living a lie with this you must know that the numbers just sold will keep me going through the tough times dream with me we forget 90 percent of it when we wake but the other 0 percent it never fades dreaming dreams of daytoday goals stay awake loads tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade oh never give up just remember just to hold out more a couple years ago i couldn't just control that thought you'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors now i'm sweating on the stage of a soldout tour writing love songs for the sake of it never to make a hit you can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick i'm not a rapper i'm a singer i just take the piss and most of these other guys are kids that pose his little sister has to babysit that's just the way it is dreams are your own just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it tread your own path you'll never make it as a follower you'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow igh
x it's what you do it's what you see i know if i'm haunting you you must be haunting me it's where we go it's where we'll be i know if i'm onto you i'm onto you onto you you must be on to me
